Introduction 
==========================================================

This document is meant to give a tutorial-like overview of how to use the code that comes 
with the subspace clustering project.

For ore detailled information, one can can refer to the reports (:download:`thesis <static/internship_report_master_2013.pdf>` or :download:`slides <static/presentation_master_2013_final.pdf>`).
 
Overview
------------------------------------
This project consists of 3 main parts: 

* pre-processing: composed of some scripts, mostly written in R to handle cleaning, formatting, binning etc.. 
* clustering: implementation of some subspace clustering algorithms (in Knime, python...). They output results in textfiles of a specific format.
* post-processing: python scripts to perform: redundancy filtering, measure scoring/ranking related tasks on files generated by clustering files. 

Source code
------------------------------------
The source code repository is hosted on github whose link is: `subspace_clustering <https://github.com/siolag161/subspace_clustering>`_.
