Introduction 
==========================================================

This document is meant to give a tutorial-like overview of how to use the code that comes 
with the subspace clustering project.

More advanced information can be accessed via "more info" links or consulted in the report (thesis/slides).
 
Overview
------------------------------------
This project consists of 3 main parts: 

* pre-processing: composed of some scripts, mostly written in R to handle cleaning, formatting, binning etc.. 
* clustering: implementation of some subspace clustering algorithms (in Knime, python...). They output results in textfiles of a specific format.
* post-processing: python scripts to perform: redundancy filtering, measure scoring/ranking related tasks on files generated by clustering files. 

Source code
------------------------------------
The source code repository is hosted on github whose link is: `subspace_clustering <https://github.com/siolag161/subspace_clustering>`_.
